	Hi friends the code in this repository can be used to automatically install a wordpress site  on your local machin. Only following information are required before you can run this file. 

 	* Root password of the system.
	* Database Username and password, which has privilage to create a database. 
	

	This code has been tested on a Ubuntu 12.04 machine, and its working perfectly.
	
	I have used Nginx as a webserver and MySql for database. you need php also to run  wordpress. Need not worry installtion of all the package have been taken care in the script. 

	You just need to download the script give execution permission and wala ;)  you can run it. If you find any problem feel free to write to me on dipinthomas2003@gmial.com. 


NOTE : update your machine before you run this script.
