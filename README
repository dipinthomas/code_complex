	Hi friends the code in this repository can be used to automatically install a wordpress on your local machin. Only following information are required before you can run this file. 

 	* Root password of the system.
	* Database Username and password, which has privilage to create a database. 
	

	This code has been tested in a Ubuntu 12.04 machine, and its workin perfectly.
	
	I have used Nginx as a webserver and MySql for database. you need php also to for the wordpress to run. Need not worry installtion of all the package have been taken care in the script. 

	You just need to download the script give execution permission and wala you can run it. If you find any problem feel free to contact me on dipinthomas2003@gmial.com.
